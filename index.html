    <p>
   I am a Junior at Georgia State University studying Computer Science with a concetration in Graphics and Human Computer Interaction. I have experience in web development, from designing websites, to web applications using javascript. I also have experience with Java, which I have used to create some java based applications </div>
      
    </p>
    <p> I am very passionate about technology and I love learning and exploring the different technologies this world has to offer. I am also very passionate about increasing diversity in technology, becasue I stronly believe that we all deserve a chance to play a role in creating and developing the technologies that shape the world we all live in.
    </p>
    <p>
    When I am not programming or doing school work, you are most likely going to find me shooting and editing Youtube videos, teaching girls how to code, exploring this beautiful world we live in or dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
   If you haven't yet noticed, I am a very creative soul and my passion for everything I do is driven by the creativity that lies within every task. From arts and crafts, to programming I'm always finding a new creative outlet.</div>

    <h2>Why did I take CSC 4720</h2>
    <p>
      I took Human Computer Interaction this semester because I wanted to learn more about creating systems and technologies for the user. Over the past few semester I have grown an interest in User experience design, and this class was the perfect opportunity for me to learn more about this field. As a future entreprenuer, I also think this is an important field to study, because in order for me to come up with my billion dollar idea, I have to uderstand who I am designing the product for, and how to go about catering the product for my clients. Then hopefully one day with a little bit of hard work (a lot!), a great idea, and great UX skills, the millions will come rolling in. Besides making me a great entreprenuer, I hope that the skills that I gain from this class help mould me into a better Software Engineer who not only can solve problems efficiently, but solves problems specifically for their user.

    <h3>"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it." ~Steve Jobs </h>
